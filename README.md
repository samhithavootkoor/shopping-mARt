# Shopping-mARt
Due to increasing online shopping portals, conventional offline stores are facing a crisis because of which they are losing their prominence.The project is to bring solution to this,that is, by empowering offline stores with the perks of online stores using Augmented Reality. Enhancing users experience will be a stepping stone to tackle this issue.Augmented reality is in trend these days,anything and everything blended with Augmented Reality is the future we are yet to see.Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory etc.

	The main aim of our project application is to bring options associated with a certain object alive to the real environment for example the price tags being popped up when we arrive at the products, mannequins as similar as the living models, reviews and details of a specific product that a user ought to know.The tools that will be used across the process are Unity,Vuforia and the programming language that will be involved internally is C-SHARP(C#).
